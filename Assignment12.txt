Major Issues with React solved BY RTK?
=>Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
Have to add a lot of packages to build a large scale application
Redux requires too much boilerplate code which makes it cumbersome to write efficient and clean code.



Explain Dispatcher?
=>hook imported from react-redux.It helps us to dispatch an action;
It takes a reducer function.

Explain Reducer?
=>these are normal js functions written inside the slice.They do not return any thing,just modify the state directly.

Explain Slice?
=>Slices are termed as logical seperation of the store.They seperate the various entities that we ned in a store

Explain Selector?
=>This helps us subscribe the store.means we can read info from the store.This hook take the store which we need to subscribe
const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items);
// store.slice_name_.state


Explain createSlice and its config?
=>

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: "name of slice",
  initialState: {
   
  },
  reducers: {
   
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      state.items.push(action.payload);
    },
   action_name:action
  },
});

export const {action_name } = cartSlice.actions; // export actions

export default cartSlice.reducer;
