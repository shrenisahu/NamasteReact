Ques5: why do we need useState hooks?
=>when we update a normal js variable ,react does not keep it with sync with the ui.those changes are not reflected in the ui,this happens because of one way data binding in react.To solve this issue we use useState hooks.React keeps track of these state variables and keeps them in sync with the ui.whenever these variables are changes react rerenders the component.

useState hook is a js function that returns an array.The first element is a state variable and the second element is a function to update that state variable.

Syntax: 
const[variable,fucntion]=useState(default Value);
